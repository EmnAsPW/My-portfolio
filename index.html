            <p>Hi, this is emon! I am extremely Passionate about accepting challenges in the Coding world. I'm trying to
                help me established my coding skills to the next level. I started tinkering with electronics as a kid
                alongside my father who had a PhD in Electrical Engineering from Stanford University. In those days we
                had a den set up with a wide assortment of test equipment. I never grew tired of working with
                oscilloscopes, variable frequency generators, frequency counters, variable power supplies, breadboards,
                logic probes, digital and analog meters, capacitor and transistor testers, and soldering
                equipment.Thanks</p>
